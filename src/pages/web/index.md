For those of you that have found yourself wondering how a basic website works behind the scenes, then you are in luck, because we are about to go over this mysterious dark magic that is better known as web development.

Imagine in your head that you are surfing the web, and to your delight, you end up at facebook.com. Once you login, you are greeted with your timeline or feed. The feed displays all of the posts of your friends. You notice that becky got herself a brand new car today, unable to help yourself, you click on the post to have a closer look. The second you clicked on becky's post, facebook sent information to the server (probably an identification number to help with searching for that post). The server takes the information given to it by the front-end (the things you see and click on), and queries the database for the rest of the information of the post to display it.

I myself am a huge fan of analogies. They help you learn unfamiliar topics by utilizing other topics that are more familiar. Think of the "Front-end", the webpage you see and interact with (buttons, inputs, etc.), as an Ice Cream Parlor. You interact with the Ice Cream Parlor (Front-End) by telling him what you want. Once you specify what you want (clicking or typing something), he then walks over to the Ice Cream Machine (The Web Server) with the information you gave him, and he passes that information to the Ice Cream Machine (by pulling the chocolate ice cream lever), and the Ice Cream Machine (Server) retrieves the overall thing you wanted (Post information) from the Ice Cream Compartment (The DataBase). The Ice Cream Compartment (DataBase) stores the Ice Cream (Information). The Ice Cream Compartment (DataBase) then passes the Ice Cream (Post info) to the Ice Cream Machine's nozzle (Server), and the Ice Cream Machine's nozzle (Server) passes the Ice Cream to the Parlor (Front-End), and finally the Parlor (Front-End) passes it to you where it is displayed accordingly, or eaten haha.

Well I hope this post has made you hungry for Ice Cream, because it has succeeded for me. Also, I hope you learned something as well! Have a fantastic day, and always remember, keep it classy.
