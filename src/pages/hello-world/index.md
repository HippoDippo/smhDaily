It is a fine weekend evening in the middle of the spring semester. Lying in your comfy dorm room bed, curled up with your lovely girlfriend, or quite possibly, your date that you semi awkwardly met on social media earlier that day, relax and gaze upon your flat screen tv that has accumulated far too much dust over the years. Yes you heard that right, I said YEARS. Leave your judgement by the door please. If you can not help yourself, then don't let the door hitcha on the way out. Ok now that we got that embarrassing part of the story out of the way, lets proceed forward, shall we?

Spread across the screen are the all too familiar letters "NETFLIX". Oh yes boys and girls, we were indeed Netflixin and Chillin simultaneously. Impressive you say? I agree and graciously thank you for your acknowledgement. As we sailed through the ocean of choices, acting as if there is barely anything to watch (you know this pain), we finally dropped anchor at "Stranger Things" island. Even though we both had watched every episode more times than we dare admit, we proceeded forward.

Hours vanish as if they were popcorn at the movies. My date sits up and starts putting on her thin zip-up hoodie as she mumbles, "I have to get back, it's getting late and my boyfriend will start getting suspicious." As you can probably guess, I asked her to repeat that ball busting sentence. After I confirmed what she said, I just sat there looking at her as she left. Once she was gone, I sat on my bed thinking about how screwed up the dating scene has gotten. I never realized how messed up it really was until that unfortunate evening. I mean.. I knew that it wasn't great, but it's so bad that even girls are cheating now? What is happening?

I guess we all just have to adapt to these "Stranger Things" happeing around us, ayyy see what I did there? Anyways, best of luck to all of you in the dating pool, although, it seems to be a shark tank nowadays, so bring your appetite!
